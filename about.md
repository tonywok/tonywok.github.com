Why hello there dear person of the internet.
My name is Tony.

You've somehow managed to stumble across my humble home on the web, <span title="aptly named, I might add">_webhaus_</span>.

I'm a [music enthusiast](https://www.last.fm/user/tsnydermtg), table top gamer, and [software engineer](https://gist.github.com/tonywok/825dc01e87f3181122bc) currently living in London with my lovely partner, [Lara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog).

For the past decade, prior to our hop across the pond, we called [Columbus, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio) (specifically, [German Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Village)) our home.
