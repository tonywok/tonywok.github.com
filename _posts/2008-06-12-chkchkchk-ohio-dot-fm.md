## Original Post

Welp, to be blunt, last night was the shit.
How often does a sweet band come in and put on free show for you?
If you answered often, I want to be your friend...
Anyway, the show, and everything having to do with the show, blew my expectations.

I arrived around seven or so, only to see a line edging closer and closer to the Flying Pizza (a sizable line).
Once I received my VIP pass (*pauses for laughter*), I headed in to the store.
I hadn't really spent much time in the store before, but it was pretty cool inside -- so trendy I felt dirty.

The show took place on the second floor with all the merch pushed to the side.
Overall the sound quality was very much _just ok_.
But then again, that's amazing when considering the building is a clothing store.

After ninja-ing a spot in front via clothing rack, it sounded loads better, with just the amps and monitors.
The set was pretty rockin', although very brief.
I remember hearing _Heart of Hearts_, _All My Heroes are Wierdos_, and _Must be the Moon_.
I was really hoping they would play _The Step_, which happens to be my favorite from their catalog.

Regardless, my face was rocked.
Here are some pics of last night, and a little video clip to give you a taste of the atmosphere.
