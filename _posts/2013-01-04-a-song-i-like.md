It starts with the realization of an impending worsening. Then the guitar comes in verifying something indeed has happened - and it’s not looking good, almost comically so. As if a third person were to come into focus and relieve the viewer of this tragic first hand experience. Fully aware that the narrator has an adept ability to shine a positive light on any situation, you consciously fall into his spell.

The vocals come in and disrupt this light-hearted view of the scene. Something’s happened. Two people were involved. Only one walks away. The survivor goes on to describe how they came to know each other; sincerely. What started as love, turned stale - both completely aware. This evolved into facing the acceptance of what’s become. My emotions begin to rise and fall as if gliding along a sine curve. The highs are a feeling of realized awareness with the goal of understanding. The lows start with despair and quickly devolve into jealousy, and finally, anger.

After countless rounds of riding up and down, understanding is achieved; the problem has revealed itself. Once defined, tone shifts, giving birth to something uplifting. As if now that information is available, it’s not only possible, but there is already a known solution - so understood that it could be recited from memory.

Quickly it is made apparent that victory isn’t enough. Instinctively, every detail and justification is spilled - a reaction so primal that it occurs despite cognitive awareness that the offender possesses nothing resembling that of intent.

Finally, exhausted, the mind is at ease.
