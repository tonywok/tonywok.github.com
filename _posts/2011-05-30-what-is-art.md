It seems that every Art class I’ve taken ends up boiling down to the same question: “What is Art ?" I think I’ve decided on a definition that works for me – for now.

> There are beautiful and thought provoking things out there that are clearly Art. That being said, I believe there are works of "art” that are certainly not Art. However, the moment someone declares one of those things as as “not Art”, it becomes Art.
