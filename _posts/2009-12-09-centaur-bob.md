One day I decided to make a chalk mural of my dear friend Bob using flourescent chalk above "the couch" of our college apartment.
Little did I know it would become my crowning artistic achievement.

Posting it here for posterity and ease of reference.

Behold his flamboyant majesty as he raises the thunder.
