I’ve always been a list maker.
I use them for games I want to play, status updates, important tasks — you name it, I have a list for it.
In fact, this blog post is an entry in my blog post ideas list!

While I clearly maintain lots of personal lists, I generally try to avoid making too many of them while programming.

Before I make my case, I want to clarify what I mean by *Static Lists*.
I’m not talking about any sort of “List” data structure or “static” keyword.
Full disclosure, I’ve made up the term for this post since I don’t yet know of a better way to to describe it.

## A Static List

I’ll start with an generic example involving some sort of workflow system involving tasks.
You can hopefully adapt this to whatever domain you find yourself in.

```ruby
TASK_NAMES = [
  "enter_data",
  "submit_for_review",
  "complete_review",
  "submit"
]
```

It's likely you’ve seen code like this and probably written it — I know I have.
Perhaps it starts as an inclusion validation or a way to populate a select box.

We have this concept called a task somewhere in our system.
It looks like there’s different types and we need to know all the names.
At face value, without being pedantic, I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong here.

## A Portable, Accessible List

Our example above suffers from a couple problems.
For one, defining the static list as a lone constant is not very portable.
Secondly, we don’t have a way to reference individual task names.

A minor ergonomic improvement could be something like this, which I’ve seen become more common in ruby apps over the years:

```ruby
module TaskNames
  ALL = [
    ENTER_DATA = "enter_data",
    SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW = "submit_for_review",
    COMPLETE_REVIEW = "complete_review",
    SUBMIT = "submit"
  ]
end
```

The module makes the list portable and the clever use of constants inside the array makes it possible to reference individual task names (e.g `TaskNames::ENTER_DATA`).
Great!

If your use case never gets more complex than this, I can definitely see a case for calling it a day and happily moving on.

## A Portable, Accessible, Unified List

At some point we gain some requirements that tempt you to make _another_ list of task names (and another, and another, and another...)
One way to achieve this is to continue the pattern like so:

```ruby
module TaskNames
  ALL = [
    # same as before
  ]

  SALES_REP_TASK_NAMES = [
    TASK_NAMES::ENTER_DATA,
    TASK_NAMES::SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW
  ]

  MANAGER_TASK_NAMES = [
    TASK_NAMES::COMPLETE_REVIEW,
    TASK_NAMES::SUBMIT
  ]
end
```

In this example, it’s becoming clear that we have some static configuration that goes along with our tasks.
As written, when we introduce new _kinds_ of tasks, it can become challenging to know all of the lists that we need to update -- especially when the lists live all over the place.

An alternate way to approach this is to unify the lists and make a new concept.

```ruby
module Tasks
  ALL = [
    ENTER_DATA = TaskConfig.new(key: :enter_data, role: :sales_rep),
    SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW = TaskConfig.new(key: :submit_for_review, role: :sales_rep),
    COMPLETE_FOR_REVIEW = TaskConfig.new(key: :complete_review, role: :manager),
    SUBMIT = TaskConfig.new(key: :submit, role: :manager)
  ]
 end

  class TaskConfig
    attr_reader :key, :role

    def initialize(key:, role:)
      @key = key
      @role = role
    end
    # NOTE: omitting manager?, sales_rep? inquiry methods for brevity
  end
end
```

We now have a single list of entries that contain the metadata we need to create new lists on the fly.

You’ll notice I changed the module name from `TaskNames` to `Tasks`.
We’re not dealing with just names anymore because we’ve _enriched_ our domain!

We can now choose to define these variant lists as constants, methods, or even put the calling code in the driver’s seat.

```ruby
  module Tasks
    # ...stuff from before...

    # option A: Accessible as a constant
    MANAGER_TASKS = ALL.select(&:manager?)

    # option B: An inquiry method you can pass external args to
    def self.manager_tasks(other_stuff)
      ALL.select { other_stuff }
    end
  end

  # option C: Leaving it up to the calling code somewhere else in the codebase.
  Tasks::ALL.select { |config|  whatever_you_need }
```

As we gain more and more requirements, we have a home for the complexity of how our a tasks need to work.
In addition, we can use this same pattern again if there’s interesting behavior within a task itself (e.g maybe a role is only _sometimes_ required for that task?)

We may also want to consider taking a look at the registry pattern if we find ourselves needing to reflect on the kinds of tasks we support.

### Config vs Runtime

I would argue what we’ve actually done is separate our “config” from our “runtime”.

The `Task` itself is managing the “runtime” state of whether or not the task has been completed or maybe the specific user that it’s assigned to.

On the other hand, our `TaskConfig`, a higher order concept, owns how a particular kind of task is "configured" — almost like a template used for creating runtime instances of Tasks :)

### A Step Further: Runtime Config

In highly dynamic situations, you may have reason to create our `TaskConfig`s on the fly (e.g defining a whole new workflow from a GUI).

The approach outlined above puts us in a nice spot since we can leverage the `TaskConfig` interface.
In other words, if we’re careful, we can write our code in such a way that users of `TaskConfig` don’t know whether they’re dealing with a statically configured `TaskConfig` or a `TaskConfig` that was instantiated from data in our database :sunglasses:

So, next time you catch yourself making many static lists, take a beat to consider whether or not you’re actually hiding a concept.
