title : Cbusjs - Romanify Kata
date  : 2011-08-18

Last night I went to the Columbus Javascript user group. A co-worker of mine was presenting on converting a traditional Rails app into a single page backbone.js app with a Rails backend. I was excited to hear that he went through some of the same hurdles that I did while hacking on a project using backbone.js (future blog post?)

Anyway, at the end of the presentations, people paired up to work on a “[code kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%28programming%29)”. The challenge was to implement a function to convert arabic numbers to roman numerals. My group worked on it for a bit in a ping-pong fashion, made some progress, but eventually called in a night since it was getting late.

After working all day in javascript and partially implementing the kata in javascript, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at something else. Since I’ve been reading a lot about lisp, I decided to give it a shot. Here’s a link to what I came up with: [romanify](https://github.com/tonywok/romanify). I’d love feedback, but be gently, my lisping is still fragile.
