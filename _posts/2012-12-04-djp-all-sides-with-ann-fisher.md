Today I was lucky enough to sit in w/ Ben Shinabery of the Dick and Jane Project on WOSUâ€™s All Sides w/ Ann Fisher for Tech Tuesday!

This past January Neo gave The Dick and Jane Project a $100,000 grant for the development of Dick and Jane Labs, an application the facilitates the collaboration between middle school students and professional musicians to create radio ready songs!
