        So, I've decided to start yet another blog. This time, however, I am 
going to commit to keeping things as simple as possible. I think this 
approach will be most condusive to posting regularly, something I've 
been meaning to do the entire summer. But, as they say, better late
than never.

As for the blog itself, I'm using the Jekyll static site generator and
github pages to host the blog. I'm still learning what can be done with
Jekyll so I'll be sure to keep you posted on any advancements I make.
