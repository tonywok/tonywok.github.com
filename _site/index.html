You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

      <p> <p>It starts with the realization of an impending worsening. Then the guitar comes in verifying something indeed has happened - and it’s not looking good, almost comically so. As if a third person were to come into focus and relieve the viewer of this tragic first hand experience. Fully aware that the narrator has an adept ability to shine a positive light on any situation, you consciously fall into his spell.</p>

      <p> <p>So I wanted to do a bit of textual analysis on the results of a redis query. Naturally I thought I could pass a couple commands to redis-cli and redirect the results to a file. Well, as it turns out, redis-cli only takes one command. I needed at least two commands in order to get the relevant results. So, how can I get that file?</p>

      <p> <p>The Rails router is awesome. But every once in a while I come across something I want to do and it’s not immediately obvious. In this particular case I wanted to have a simple nested resource with a scope.</p>

      <p> <p>I use git-pair pretty heavily. It’s really nice for assigning blame to whoever checked in crappy code :P Seriously though, it’s nice to give credit where credit is due. However, one thing I am often guilty of is forgetting to change the git-pair. Most of the time I realize what I’ve done after a few commits.</p>

      <p> <p>It wasn’t too long ago I was working on a command line application. Luckily, ruby makes parsing the command line pretty trivial with the OptionParser. OptionParser works great if you want to specify command line arguments with flags. However, sometimes you want to accept options in a more declarative style.</p>

      </h2>
      <p> <p>One of the biggest challenges in web development is knowing when to break your monolithic application into services. If you segment too soon, you risk introducing unnecessary complexity. On the other hand, if you wait too long, your application is prone to becoming an unmaintainable ball of mud. I obviously can’t give you a concrete answer to this problem. However, if you decide to break your application into services, there is one thing that remains constant; securing your services’ endpoints. I’ve found Rack middleware to be an excellent tool for the job.</p>

      <p> <p>So, I have almost completely made the switch from MacVim to terminal vim. It hasn’t been easy giving up a lot of the niceties that come for free with MacVim. But, there was one thing in particular that really bothered me – copying code from vim and pasting it somewhere else.</p>
