      <p>I started up a new blog a few weeks ago, and I have to admit the timing was about as bad as it could be. I think I made my first post a day after the new quarter started at <span class="caps">OSU</span>. So, needless to say, I’ve fallen a bit behind. However, now that I’ve had some time to settle into my schedule, I want to get back to it.</p> <p>This quarter I’m taking my senior capstone, <span class="caps">CSE</span> 762: Web Services. It’s a project based class that aims to simulate what it’s like to work at a small consultancy for a real client. Also, it just so happened that I was trying to find a solid project to work on while I go through the EdgeCase Apprenticeship Program. After a few meetings defining the project and a string of...

But on January 1st of 2009 I got my first &#8220;real&#8221; job.</p> <p>I was hired by <a href="http:://honors-scholars.osu.edu/studioct/index.html">StudioCT</a>, a web design and development shop run through The Ohio State University Honors and Scholars program StudioCT is managed by David McIntyre and Ray Arebalo. Thanks to them, I gained my first real web programming experience. Up until that point my only familiarity with web programming had come from taking a few of the classes offered by the <a href="http://www.mmcscholars.com/">Media, Marketing and Communications Scholars Program</a>. I played around with .Net 2.0 using C# under the much appreciated guidance of Jimmy Lauzau, scattering in some php with Anish Minstry. However, my results were only of moderate success, which was discouraging. Working at studioCT quickly changed this,...
